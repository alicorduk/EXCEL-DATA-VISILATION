Overview:
This repository contains an Excel-based project that analyzes bike sales data. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to provide insights into bike purchasing patterns based on various attributes.

File Contents:
bike_buyers: Raw data about bike buyers, including attributes such as region, age, occupation, commute distance, and car ownership.
Working Sheet: Intermediate calculations, data cleaning steps, and preparation for analysis.
Pivot Table: Summarized data using pivot tables to analyze relationships between different variables.
Dashboard: Visual representations of the data analysis for easy interpretation.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Initial Data Import:

The raw data was imported from the "Excel Project Dataset.xlsx" file.
Data Cleaning Steps:

Removal of Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure data accuracy.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were filled using appropriate methods such as mean imputation for numerical data and mode imputation for categorical data.
Standardization: Ensured consistency in data formatting, such as uniform date formats and standardized text cases.
Outlier Detection: Identified and addressed outliers that could skew the analysis, using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
Data Transformation:

Derived Columns: Created new columns based on existing data, such as categorizing ages into age brackets.
Normalization: Scaled numerical data to a standard range to improve the accuracy of the analysis.
Aggregation: Summarized data to create meaningful groups, such as total bike purchases by region or occupation.
Dashboard Creation:
Design:

Key Metrics Identification: Determined the key metrics and KPIs to be displayed on the dashboard, such as total bike purchases, purchases by occupation, region, and commute distance.
Layout Planning: Designed the layout to ensure clarity and ease of interpretation, using charts and tables effectively.
Implementation:

Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data for various dimensions and measures.
Charts and Graphs: Used Excelâ€™s charting tools to create visual representations of the pivot table data. Key charts include:
Bar charts for bike purchases by occupation and region.
Line charts to show trends over time if time-series data is available.
Pie charts for the proportion of bike purchases by different categories.
Interactive Elements: Added slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the dashboard and drill down into specific data segments.
Final Touches:

Titles and Labels: Ensured all charts and tables have clear titles and axis labels.
Formatting: Applied consistent formatting for readability, including font styles, colors, and borders.
Validation: Reviewed the dashboard to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data presented.
Instructions:
Navigating the File:

Open the Excel file and navigate through the different sheets using the tabs at the bottom of the workbook.
Each sheet contains specific data or analysis pertinent to understanding bike purchase trends.
Using the Pivot Table Sheet:

The Pivot Table sheet provides interactive summaries. You can filter and sort data within the pivot tables to explore specific insights.
Modify the fields in the Pivot Chart Fields pane to customize the analysis as needed.
Interpreting the Dashboard:

The Dashboard sheet presents key insights through visualizations. Use this sheet for a quick overview and interpretation of the analysis results.
Refer to the chart titles and axis labels for understanding the data dimensions and measures.
Customizing the Analysis:

Feel free to modify the existing charts or create new pivot tables and charts based on the raw data in the bike_buyers sheet and the working data in the Working Sheet.
Use Excel's built-in features to filter, sort, and analyze the data according to your needs.
